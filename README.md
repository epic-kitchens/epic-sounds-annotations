# EPIC-SOUNDS Dataset

We introduce [EPIC-SOUNDS](https://epic-kitchens.github.io/epic-sounds/), a large scale dataset of audio annotations capturing temporal extents and class labels within the audio stream of the egocentric videos from EPIC-KITCHENS-100. EPIC-SOUNDS includes 78.4k categorised and 39.2k non-categorised segments of audible events and actions, distributed across 44 classes. In this repository, we provide labelled temporal timestamps for the train / val split, and just the timestamps for the recognition test split. We also provided the temporal timestamps for annotations that could not be clustered into one of our 44 classes, along with the free-form description used during the initial annotation. We train and evaluate two state-of-the-art audio recognition models on our dataset, which we also provide the code and pretrained models for.

## Download the Data
A download script is provided for the videos [here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/download-scripts-100). You will have to extract the untrimmed audios from these videos. Instructions on how to extract and format the audio into a HDF5 dataset can be found on the [Auditory SlowFast](https://github.com/ekazakos/auditory-slow-fast) GitHub repo. Alternatively, you can email [uob-epic-kitchens@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:uob-epic-kitchens@bristol.ac.uk) for access to an existing HDF5 file.
